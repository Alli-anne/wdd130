                <p id="little_woman_paragraph">With this project I was asked to make a poster for a production.<br>
                     In this poster it has photos of all the cast members. I gave it a college type <br> 
                     of look to give it an older look. I loved this project and being able to add so much<br>
                    personality of this group and feel like that they are really apart of the show. Along with <br>
                    this I also designed the tickets and playbill with taking all the production photos.</p>

                <p id="decoding_dyslexia_paragraph">I had the chance to be able to work with Decoding Dyslexia Utah<br>
                    to do some work for their conference. This includes making post cards and trifolds to send to potential attenders<br> 
                    of the confernce. I also got to make a poster for all the sponsors. Along with this I was able to a schedule with the different rooms speakers. <br>
                    I was apart of this group a couple of years before making this logo. This group talks to teachers about dyslexia to help <br>
                    others be able to understand it better. As being apart of this group I asked if there was anything they needed help with. They were looking<br>
                    for a new logo and asked me to make a couple of designs that could be used as the logo. This was very important to me because this group does so much great<br>
                    work for people and being able to help even after I left the group meant so much to me.</p>
