        Who I am
	My name is Allison Price. I go to school at byui. I love graphic design and web development. I enjoy music in theater. I would like to say I’m a very detail oriented person and love to look at the little details in things to make it better.

Why I do what I doi
	I love when art is able to show someones personality because we are all different. So when doing a project I want to make it as personal to a group of people as I can. With all my design and photography this is what I strive for.

      <h3>Graphic Design</h3>
      <p>
        -little woman 
	With this project I was asked to make a poster for a production. In this poster it has photos of all the cast members. I gave it a college type of look to give it an older look.I loved this project and being able to add so much personality of this group and feel like that they are really apart of the show. Along with this I also designed the tickets and playbill with taking all the production photos. 
-Decoding dyslexia Utah reading summit
	I had the chance to be able to work with Decoding Dyslexia Utah to do some work for their conference. This includes making post cards and trifolds to send to potential attenders of the confernce. I also got to make a poster for all the sponsors. Along with this I was able to a schedule with the different rooms speakers. 
-Youth Advocate
	I was apart of this group a couple of years before making this logo. This group talks to teachers about dyslexia to help others be able to understand it better. As being apart of this group I asked if there was anything they needed help with. They were looking for a new logo and asked me to make a couple of designs that could be used as the logo. This was very important to me because this group does so much great work for people and being able to help even after I left the group meant so much to me. 
Yearbook
	A lot of my work come from being able to be apart of the schools yearbook. In this I got to take 1,000’s of photos of my classmates. With this project I really was able to get to grow and find a way to have peoples personalities show. This book showed the whole year and is something that my classmates will look back for years to come.

      <h3>Photography</h3>
      <p>
        With my photography I really try to capture a moment in time.
         <br> I love to taken the rules of design and then take <br>
         photos that show what people were like in the <br>
         moment and so that it is something they can always have.
